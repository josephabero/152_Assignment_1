152 Assignment 1: Lexical Analyzer

By: Joseph Abero, Jon Andrew Hernandez, Gong Huang, and Colin Shardt

Code is written in C++ and project can be built and run in the IDE of your choice. 
These are steps to run in command line.

TO RUN
--------
To compile in command line, enter the src directory and run commands:

> make
> make run
> make clean

make: 			builds main.cpp
make run: 		runs project (observe console output)
make clean: 	removes main.exe, must run make again to run project

-I- If changes are made to class files (lexer.cpp, token.cpp, etc), 'make clean', then 'make'


TO ADJUST INPUT
----------------
Adjust string field of lexer.input found in main.cpp to desired program to test. 

Make sure '\' character is placed at the end of a line if string input uses multiple lines.

EXAMPLE) 

    lexer.input = 
    	// TEST INPUT 1
    	"{ \
            int b; b = 1; \
            { \
                int a; a = 2; \
                do a = a+1; while(a < 100); \
            } \
        }";
