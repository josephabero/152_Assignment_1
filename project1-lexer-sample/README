/* A modified sample lexer from the dragon book. */

First, you need to install JDK on your machine if you haven't
done so. After installation, you may need to update your
environment variables (e.g., JAVA_HOME and PATH) so that
you can invoke javac from command line. If you use an IDE,
configure your IDE so that it can find your Java installation
and use its libraries.

Depending on whether you use command line or an IDE, follow
one of the below two instructions to get the sample compiled
and run:

1. If you use command line
To compile in command line, enter the src directory and run

javac symbols/*.java
javac lexer/*.java
javac main/Main.java

To run the lexer in command line:

java  main.Main < test_file

2. If you use IntelliJ Idea IDE
In the IntelliJ IDE, create a project and import the code. Then use
the below steps to build and run:
(1) Under "Run"->"Edit Configurations", put main.Main as main class.
Specify your test file in "Redirect input from".
(2) Click "Run"->"Run Main"
